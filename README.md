# Raftaar Sports Pages

This repository hosts two simple GitHub Pages:

- `raftaar-sports-home/` is the public landing page for the Raftaar Sports Video Uploader, linking to the privacy policy.
- `index.html` at the repository root serves the existing privacy policy for the app and remains unchanged.

When published via GitHub Pages, access the pages at:

- Home: `https://<github-username>.github.io/raftaar-sports-meta-privacy-policy/raftaar-sports-home/`
- Privacy: `https://<github-username>.github.io/raftaar-sports-meta-privacy-policy/`

No build tools are required; both folders are plain HTML and ready for GitHub Pages hosting.
